\chapter{Case Study}
\label{ch:casestudy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter presents the application of the complete \gls{NMR} workflow to a real \gls{3D} dataset. The \gls{NMR} workflow is designed to capture the spatial features of non‚ÄêGaussian distributions in a way that the multi-Gaussian assumption and a \gls{LMR} cannot. The goal of the case study is to construct an \gls{NMR} spatial model and compare it to a traditional model. The dataset comes from a mineral deposit where the project operator have noted non-Gaussian characteristics within drillholes.

The workflow consists of (1) inferring the parameters that map the latent space to the observed space with \texttt{NMROPT} and (2) imputing the latent factors at the data locations with \texttt{NMRIMP} that return the true values when mapped. The mapping is non-linear and inferred such that all desired two- and multipoint statistics are captured in the final realizations. The idea is that the \gls{NMR} realizations can capture non-Gaussian spatial features such as asymmetric indicator variograms and connectivity of extreme values. Twenty-five conditional realizations are generated with the \gls{NMR}, and pertinent model statistics are checked and compared to \gls{SGS}.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
\label{sec:eda}

The complete dataset consists of $27,983$ values nominally composited to 5 meters. All coordinates are transformed such that the spatial centroid of the data is $(x=0,y=0,z=0)$. For cross-validation purposes, approximately 30\% of the data (predominantly drilled in higher-grade areas) is withheld as a `test set'. Figure \ref{fig:datasets} shows \glspl{CDF} and basic summary statistics for the `training' and `test' datasets. All subsequent modeling considers only the training dataset and the test set is utilized in Section \ref{sec:compare}.

Experimental variograms are first calculated using an omni-directional search that informs the nugget effect. This search uses short lags to highlight shape and range of the short scale continuity. Figure \ref{fig:omni} suggests a nugget effect of near zero, and that an exponential variogram shape is appropriate for the modeled variable. Directional experimental variograms are calculated first in original units and fitted with an exponential model. Figure \ref{fig:orig_expvar} shows the fitted experimental points and Table \ref{tab:orig_expvar} shows the model parameters. The original units variogram defines the search orientation and anisotropy for estimator based declustering. Indicator variograms are calculated for the 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 quantiles of the grade distribution. Figures \ref{fig:ind_expvar} shows the fitted indicator variogram models and Table \ref{tab:ind_expvar} summarizes the model parameters.

Transformation to Gaussian space requires a representative \gls{CDF}. Declustering weights are produced using \gls{ID2} estimation. A grid of 5x5x5 meter blocks is produced considering a 25-meter buffer in the x, y, and z directions around all available data (the \gls{SMU} grid). \Gls{ID2} estimation weights for each data are accumulated during an estimation run and used as declustering weights. The idea is that data located in dense regions receive less total weight as many data are present in the search neighbourhood. In sparse areas data receive more weight as there are fewer data in the search neighbourhood. Estimator declustering is more robust than traditional cell declustering in the presence of irregular data configurations as the principal orientation of continuity can be captured by the search ellipse. The limits of the estimation grid must be well-defined to prevent unintended edge effects \cite{Wilde2007}. Figure \ref{fig:declus_cdf} shows the clustered (black) and declustered \gls{CDF} (red).

After normal score transform the experimental variogram of the normal scores is calculated and fitted with a model. Figure \ref{fig:ns_expvar} shows the fitted experimental points and Table \ref{tab:ns_expvar} shows the model parameters. A normal score variogram permits calculation of accuracy metrics, particularly the actual fraction of true values that fall within specified probability intervals. Figure \ref{fig:ns_xval} shows a leave-one-drillhole out cross validation and accuracy plot for the fitted normal score variogram model. The scatter plot shows a reasonable \gls{SOR} and reproduction of the true mean. The accuracy plot suggests a reasonable space of uncertainty for the fitted model.

The final step of \gls{EDA} is to generate a reference model for validation purposes. An exhaustive model is generated with \gls{OK} considering a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 40 composites using a search ellipse with ranges and angles aligned with the fitted original units variogram model (Table \ref{tab:orig_expvar}).

\section{Network Parameter Inference}
\label{sec:param}

Parameterization of the \gls{NMR} requires the definition of (1) optimization targets, (2) a pool of latent Gaussian factors, (3) architecture of the network and (4) optimization hyperparameters. The continuous normal score, and indicator variograms from Section \ref{sec:eda} become optimization targets for parameterizing the \gls{NMR}. Target sequence and runs distributions are calculated internally from the drillhole data by \texttt{NMROPT}.

The initial step in defining the Gaussian pool is checking how well a traditional simulation algortithm (e.g.\ \gls{SGS}) reproduces the optimization target only considering the continuous variogram. This ``base-case'' model provides insight into what features are required to achieve the desired targets. \Gls{SGS} performs well reproducing the continuous and all indicator variograms; this is likely due to the data density of the training dataset. Though variograms are well reproduced, there is a discrepancy between downhole sequences from the data and the base-case model. Figure \ref{fig:data_sgs_runs} shows cumulative run length frequencies above the 0.9 quantile calculated directly from the data (red) and the expected value of gridded \gls{SGS} realizations (black). This discrepancy suggests additional high-grade continuity is required up to a length of approximately 30m (six connected five-meter composites).

\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75, max size={\textwidth}{\textheight}]{./0-Figures/06-Ch6/data_sgs_runs.png}
    \caption{Cumulative run length frequencies above the 0.9 quantile from the drillhole data and the base-case \gls{SGS} model.}
    \label{fig:data_sgs_runs}
\end{figure}

Decomposition of the target variogram structures into individual components forms the initial latent Gaussian pool. That is, each nested variogram structure defines the covariance of a latent factor with zero nugget and sill of 1.0. As the continuous variogram also reproduces the indicator variograms the initial pool consists of the two nested structures in Table \ref{tab:ns_expvar} for a total of $2 + 1 = 3$ (plus one for the nugget effect) factors. Additional structures are added to pool that correspond with high-grade features of the conceptual geological model and the overall orientation of drilling. As a pure nugget factor is added to the pool, any structure with a major range less than 30 meters is pruned to prevent adding too much noise to the network inputs. Though the network can filter this noise, experiments show some level of pruning improves the final parameter inference. Table \ref{tab:pool} shows the covariance structure of each component in the final pool, excluding the nugget factor. Factors 3 and 4 correspond to high-grade structures.


% Additional structures are added to pool that correspond with high-grade clusters. The grade distribution is thresholded at the $95^{th}$ quantile generating a binary indicator. Agglomerative clustering \citep{mullner2011modern} generates spatially coherent clusters using x, y, z coordinates and the continuous variable. Cluster orientations and anisotropies are determined from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the 3x3 covariance matrix of cluster coordinates. The x, y, and z components of the eigenvectors form \gls{GSLIB} style rotation angles as:
% \begin{align}
%     \text{azm} & = 90 - \text{atan2}(y, x) * 180/\pi               \\
%     \text{dip} & = \text{atan2}(z, \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}) * 180/\pi
%     \label{eq:azmdip}
% \end{align}

\end{table}

The choice of activation function exponent, $\omega$, controls each factor's influence on either high or low values. $\omega < 1$ emphasizes low values (<0 in Gaussian units) and $\omega > 1$ emphasizes high values (>0 in Gaussian units). Table \ref{tab:omega} shows the minimum and maximum bound for each trainable $\omega$ parameter. Factors 1 and 2 are constrained to be relatively neutral, that is influencing both high and low values but centered about $1.0$, while Factors 3 and 4 are constrained to influence high values only. The nugget effect factor is constrained to $\omega=1$.

    \label{tab:omega}
\end{table}

The network architecture is dictated by the number of factors in the Gaussian pool. The pool consists of 4 structures, plus one for the nugget, for a total of 5 latent Gaussian factors, resulting in an input layer of five nodes. Each input node has a single connection weight to a single hidden layer of the same dimension as the input. The network has a total of $2 \cdot M = 10$ trainable parameters; five connection weights and five $\omega$ values.

Table \ref{tab:de_params} shows \gls{DE} parameters. The indicator thresholds used for optimization correspond to the indicator variograms in Section \ref{sec:eda}, that is, $G^{-1}([0.1, 0.5, 0.9])$ where $G^{-1}$ is the inverse of the Gaussian \gls{CDF}. Runs and $n$-point connectivity are calculated up to a maximum of 10 steps ($\approx$50m).

Network optimization is run for 1500 iterations resulting in a reasonably stable objective function value. The objective function value (Figure \ref{fig:fobj}) does not reach zero as it is the expected value across all realizations. Though the objective function components are weighted, any deviation in the number of runs can lead to larger objective function values. Table \ref{tab:opt_omega} shows the final optimized connection weight and  $\omega$ parameters. Figures \ref{fig:nmropt_uncond_real0_xy} to \ref{fig:nmropt_uncond_real0_yz} show the first unconditional realization at the data locations generated by \texttt{NMROPT}. Objective components are calculated using these realizations.

}

A critical component of the \texttt{NMROPT} workflow is checking the reproduction of the optimization targets. Deviations from these targets will likely manifest in the imputed conditioning data and final realizations.  Figures \ref{fig:nmropt_repro_vario}, \ref{fig:nmropt_repro_ivario}, \ref{fig:nmropt_repro_runs} show variogram, indicator variogram and cumulative run-length frequency reproduction with the optimal \gls{NMR} parameters. Variogram and indicator variogram reproduction is reasonable though there is some deviation from the target model, particularly at shorter ranges in the principal directions. This deviation comes at the expense of increasing high-grade (0.9 quantile) continuity in the direction of drilling (roughly parallel to the tertiary variogram direction). This increased continuity is evident in the 0.9 quantile run-length frequency plot (Figure \ref{fig:nmropt_repro_runs} right) where the unconditional \texttt{NMROPT} realizations show continuity greater than that in the data. As a consequence the 0.1 and 0.5 quantiles show slightly decreased continuity relative to the data (Figure \ref{fig:nmropt_repro_runs} left and center). This increased continuity is advantageous as results show the effect of conditioning in the final realizations can reduce extreme value continuity.

\section{Latent Factor Imputation}
\label{sec:fact_imp}

The optimized \gls{NMR} parameters from Section \ref{sec:param} are the basis for latent factor imputation. The optimized parameters and the Gaussian pool are input to the program \texttt{NMRIMP} and realizations of latent factors are computed via \gls{SGRI}. \csnreals \ realizations are imputed for each factor specified in the Gaussian pool, plus the nugget effect. All imputed realizations are checked to ensure they (1) reproduce the data within the specified polishing tolerance (Table XX); (2) imputed realizations are on average univariate Gaussian; (3) imputed factors are on average uncorrelated; and (4) each imputed factor on average reproduces its single structure variogram model.

Figure \ref{fig:imputed_vs_data} shows the scatter plot of hard data values and the corresponding imputed values in normal score units. The imputed values in this context are the five latent factors mixed through the optimal \gls{NMR} and normal score transformed. There is roughly perfect correlation between data and imputed values and no delta values exceed the specified polishing tolerance. Figure \ref{fig:factor_cdfs} shows that each imputed factor is on average univariate Gaussian and Figure \ref{fig:fact_corrmat} shows the imputed factors are effectively uncorrelated. The left matrix is randomly generated, independent Gaussian data as a reference, and the right matrix is the average correlation between imputed values over \csnreals \ realizations. Figure \ref{fig:nmrimp_repro_gvario} shows variogram reproduction for each imputed factor. There is some deviation from the specified target models though overall, variogram reproduction is reasonable.

\section{Latent Factor Simulation}
\label{sec:fact_sim}

Imputed factor realizations from Section \ref{sec:fact_imp} become conditioning data for gridded factor realizations. Each univariate Gaussian factor realization is used to condition a gridded realization in a one-for-one fashion. That is, a unique data realization is used for each simulated realization. Gridded realizations in this case-study are simulated using \gls{SGS} though any conditional simulation algortithm is valid.

The point scale simulation grid utilizes a cell size of 2.5 x 2.5 x 5m for a total of 2,236,948 nodes; Table \ref{tab:simgrid} summarizes its parameters. \csnreals \ realizations of each factor are simulated and checked similar to any other Gaussian simulation workflow. The realizations are on average univariate Gaussian and reproduce the variogram. Figure \ref{fig:gridded_factors} shows a plan-view section through the first realization of the gridded factors.

\end{figure}

Once factors are defined at all grid nodes they are mapped from latent to observed space through application of the optimized \gls{NMR}. Mapping consists of interpolating the raw activation values (\gls{NMR} output) with the normal score reference distribution generated by \texttt{NMRIMP}. Using a single reference distribution ensures consistency between imputation and gridded simulation. The \gls{NMR} realizations are checked ensuring they reproduce the continuous variogram model, indicator variogram models and cumulative run-length frequencies, as well as being on average univariate Gaussian. Figures \ref{fig:ns_reals_xy} to \ref{fig:ns_reals_yz} show sections through the first \gls{NMR} realization mapped to Gaussian units.
